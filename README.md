# Gene_Symbol_to_UniProtID
Convert gene symbols to UniProt ID and Protein Name including isoforms

You will need to download the excel file from the UniProt onto your local machine for this function.
Besides that, all you need is separate csv's for up- and down-regulated genes. 
The function will concatenate them into one csv for export.

At the end, you will have the opportunity to check for isoforms if all genes are not mapped to UniProtIDs.
